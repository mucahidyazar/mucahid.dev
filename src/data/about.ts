Getir has lots of big projects. And we are developing the biggest and Getir's main project which is a shopping web application. And we are using and developing our own UI library. The application is in the process of a micro frontend structure. We are almost done. We used NX for the micro frontends base. And also I moved the UI library to monorepo base by using Lerna. And I got my responsibility and I got some time to develop this project. And I moved all projects to Lerna and I prepared a presentation and I presented the new UI library for an hour by Lerna. But it has been rejected by the team. But that is the most exciting work for me at Getir. And we are using some technologies whose names are react, next.js, react-hooks-form, redux, redux-saga, next-i18next, bitbuxcket, bitbucket pipelines, sentry, styledcomponents, git",

      "This is the best project I have ever worked on so far. I learned lots of things and I got two-step up together. I can say Getir is a milestone on my career. I improved so much myself on developing and on engineering, I got lots of responsibilities and lots of work. Getir is the fastest grocery app in Turkey and Getir is the biggest company in Turkey. I am working with lots of amazing engineers. So I learned lots of things at Getir. Getir was a monolith project firstly, but at the end of 2022 we moved the app as a micro frontend base by using the tool which name is NX. And Getir has 5 sub-app inside itself. One of them is a food delivery app. I was working on that part with 3 frontend developers. But we also have responsibility on the common parts all together by 16 frontend developers. So we have a sync meeting twice a week by 16 developers. We are discussing the common problems and common improvements on app. And we get some decisions and we are improving our app together. And also we have a private Getir UI library on npm. I liked it so much and if you can have a chance to see the commit you would see my contributions on it so much. I love that UI library so much. As I said in my company section, I moved that UI library from monolith to monorepo just myself but on the voting, it has been rejected by 5/8. :) But it was an amazing experience for me.

      "This was the second big SASS project that I had worked on. It was an e-commerce app. After Granobra(the company) and biletsepeti(the project), I got my second full-time job. I was working at Maxithings. It was a startup. And they hired me to manage and built for a SASS project. They wanted me to make a copy for an e-commerce app of a Turkish company whose name is https://www.trendyol.com. Everything and every decision on the project were chosen and decided by me for the frontend side. We were working with 4 developers on this project. We were 4 guys who are 1 frontend(me), 2 backends, 1 platform. I was a junior but I was working as a senior web developer. I faced lots of critical issues, but I solved all of them by myself. I decided which technologies I should use, I choose which tools which I use, I decided everything for the web app. That was an amazing experience for me. I completed that project for 4-5 months. Then we dockerized the project lastly and we released the project. After that time I had got my best offer from Getir and I quit and I join my new amazing journey.

I am developing the third version by all of my experience and the best practices which I learned so far. Nowadays I am learning about web3 and blockchain technologies. I was thinking to implement a blockchain message system in my blog. I created its pages on Figma and I will share them on my Github after the release.
